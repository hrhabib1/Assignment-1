             <h2>Food for a family</h2>
             <p>We know that no one can survive without food. There are various water borne diseases in flood prone areas so nutritious food is needed for good health at this time. So let's cooperate and stand by their side.</p>

            <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
            <p>At this time the helpless families have no consciousness. They do not know what to do or where to go. So in such a situation they need to be given guidelines.</p>

            <h2>Education for a child</h2>
            <p>Helpless families are left with the responsibility of running their families, so they keep their children away from education for fear of paying for their education. So we should cooperate with them to ensure the education of the children.</p>
